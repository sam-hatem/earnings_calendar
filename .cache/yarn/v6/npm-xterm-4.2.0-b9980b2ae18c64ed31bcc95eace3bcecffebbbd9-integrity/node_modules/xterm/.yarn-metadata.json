It's used by popular projects such as VS Code, Hyper and Theia.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Terminal apps just work**: Xterm.js works with most terminal apps such as `bash`, `vim` and `tmux`, this includes support for curses-based apps and mouse event support.\n- **Performant**: Xterm.js is *really* fast, it even includes a GPU-accelerated renderer.\n- **Rich unicode support**: Supports CJK, emojis and IMEs.\n- **Self-contained**: Requires zero dependencies to work.\n- **Accessible**: Screen reader support can be turned on using the `screenReaderMode` option.\n- **And much more**: Links, theming, addons, well documented API, etc.\n\n## What xterm.js is not\n\n- Xterm.js is not a terminal application that you can download and use on your computer.\n- Xterm.js is not `bash`. Xterm.js can be connected to processes like `bash` and let you interact with them (provide input, receive output).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst you need to install the module, we ship exclusively through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) so you need that installed and then add xterm.js as a dependency by running:\n\n```\nnpm install xterm\n```\n\nTo start using xterm.js on your browser, add the `xterm.js` and `xterm.css` to the head of your html page. Then create a `<div id=\"terminal\"></div>` onto which xterm can attach itself. Finally instantiate the `Terminal` object and then call the `open` function with the DOM object of the `div`.\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n  <html>\n    <head>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/xterm/css/xterm.css\" />\n      <script src=\"node_modules/xterm/lib/xterm.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      <div id=\"terminal\"></div>\n      <script>\n        var term = new Terminal();\n        term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));\n        term.write('Hello from \\x1B[1;3;31mxterm.js\\x1B[0m $ ')\n      </script>\n    </body>\n  </html>\n```\n\n### Importing\n\nThe recommended way to load xterm.js is via the ES6 module syntax:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Terminal } from 'xterm';\n```\n\n### Addons\n\n⚠️ *This section describes the new addon format introduced in v3.14.0, see [here](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/3.14.2/README.md#addons) for the instructions on the old format*\n\nAddons are separate modules that extend the `Terminal` by building on the [xterm.js API](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/typings/xterm.d.ts). To use an addon you first need to install it in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -S xterm-addon-web-links\n```\n\nThen import the addon, instantiate it and call `Terminal.loadAddon`:\n\n```ts\nimport { Terminal } from 'xterm';\nimport { WebLinksAddon } from 'xterm-addon-web-links';\n\nconst terminal = new Terminal();\n// Load WebLinksAddon on terminal, this is all that's needed to get web links\n// working in the terminal.\nterminal.loadAddon(new WebLinksAddon());\n```\n\nThe xterm.js team maintains the following addons but they can be built by anyone:\n\n- [`xterm-addon-attach`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/xterm-addon-attach): Attaches to a server running a process via a websocket\n- [`xterm-addon-fit`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/xterm-addon-fit): Fits the terminal to the containing element\n- [`xterm-addon-search`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/xterm-addon-search): Adds search functionality\n- [`xterm-addon-web-links`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/xterm-addon-web-links): Adds web link detection and interaction\n\n## Browser Support\n\nSince xterm.js is typically implemented as a developer tool, only modern browsers are supported officially. Specifically the latest versions of *Chrome*, *Edge*, *Firefox* and *Safari*.\n\nWe also partially support *Intenet Explorer 11*, meaning xterm.js should work for the most part, but we reserve the right to not provide workarounds specifically for it unless it's absolutely necessary to get the basic input/output flow working.\n\nXterm.js works seamlessly in [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) apps and may even work on earlier versions of the browsers, these are the versions we strive to keep working.\n\n## API\n\nThe full API for xterm.js is contained within the [TypeScript declaration file](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/typings/xterm.d.ts), use the branch/tag picker in GitHub (`w`) to navigate to the correct version of the API.\n\nNote that some APIs are marked *experimental*, these are added to enable experimentation with new ideas without committing to support it like a normal [semver](https://semver.org/) API. Note that these APIs can change radically between versions so be sure to read release notes if you plan on using experimental APIs.\n\n## Real-world uses\nXterm.js is used in several world-class applications to provide great terminal experiences.\n\n- [**SourceLair**](https://www.sourcelair.com/): In-browser IDE that provides its users with fully-featured Linux terminals based on xterm.js.\n- [**Microsoft Visual Studio Code**](http://code.visualstudio.com/): Modern, versatile and powerful open source code editor that provides an integrated terminal based on xterm.js.\n- [**ttyd**](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd): A command-line tool for sharing terminal over the web, with fully-featured terminal emulation based on xterm.js.\n- [**Katacoda**](https://www.katacoda.com/): Katacoda is an Interactive Learning Platform for software developers, covering the latest Cloud Native technologies.\n- [**Eclipse Che**](http://www.eclipse.org/che): Developer workspace server, cloud IDE, and Eclipse next-generation IDE.\n- [**Codenvy**](http://www.codenvy.com): Cloud workspaces for development teams.\n- [**CoderPad**](https://coderpad.io): Online interviewing platform for programmers.
